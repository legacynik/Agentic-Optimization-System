description: Quick checkpoint — save progress without ending session

# Session Update

Lightweight checkpoint. Intentionally minimal.

## Steps

1. Scan recent work in conversation
2. Append timestamped entry to `current-state.md` (1-3 bullets)
3. If a decision was made → append to `decisions.md`
4. If material state changed → update active task and progress

## Output

```
Checkpointed: [2-5 word description]
```

Nothing more. This is not `/session-end`.
